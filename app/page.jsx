        <p>
          Iâ€™m an artisan engineer studying Computer Science at the University of
          Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I currently live in Vienna, Austria.

        <p>
          I spend most of my time creating, learning, exercising, and
          socializing - preferably outdoors.

          I've tried to design this website in a manner that reveals more about
          myself, my work, and my values than a few words on the home page do.
          Make yourself comfortable, take a look around, and if anything
          resonates with you, say hi :)
